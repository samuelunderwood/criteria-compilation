title: Formatting Norms
---

<p>Some editorial measures were taken while transcribing the values from their original sources. These changes were intended to improve filterability and avoid an unnecessarily long list of room type labels which differed only in syntax/spelling while referring to the same room function. Work is currently underway to bring the database in alignment with these formatting norms.</p>
<h2>Formatting Norms</h2>

<h3>1. Plural noun room types</h3>
<p>All room type labels have been transcribed in plural form.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Concert halls' and not 'Concert hall'</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3>2. Capitalization</h3>
<p>Categories Use Title Case (every word capitalized)</p>
<p>Room type labels use sentence case (only the first word capitalized)</p>
<hr>
<h3>3.&nbsp;Nomenclature alignment</h3>
<p>Where possible, room type labels have been tweaked to use similar nomenclature. <br /> <br /> For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"General classrooms" and "schoolrooms" have been transcribed simply as "classrooms"</p>
<p>"Cinemas" and "movie theaters" have been transcribed simply as "movie theaters"</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3>4.Qualifiers/subtypes</h3>
<p>Many resources delineate qualifiers for specific sub-categories of a room use. Common qualifiers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subjective size (small, large)</li>
<li>Objective size/volume/seating capacity (ranges in m<sup>3</sup> or ft<sup>3</sup>, or number of seats)</li>
<li>Amplified vs. unamplified speech</li>
<li>Quality (industry, premium, loud vs. quiet)</li>
<li>Class (Class A/Class B/Class C/Class D)</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, other references make no such distinction. To make it easier to see criteria for a common group, qualifiers are listed separately in the 'subtype' column</p>
